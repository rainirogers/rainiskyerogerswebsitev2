    <h2>Somebody Has To</h2>
    <p class="byline">A Poem by Shel Silverstein</p>

    <p>Somebody has to go polish the stars,<br />
      They're looking a little bit dull.</p>
    <p>
      Somebody has to go polish the stars,<br />
      For the eagles and starlings and gulls</p>
    <p>
      Have all been complaining they're tarnished and worn,<br />
      They say they want new ones we cannot afford.</p>
    <p>So please get your rags<br />
      And your polishing jars,<br />
      Somebody has to go polish the stars.</p>
